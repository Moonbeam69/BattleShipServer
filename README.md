# BattleShipServer

This is my fiirst attempt at creating a rest controller using the BootSpring framework. This is the server that functions as the game host in a player versus computer naval startegy game based loosly on Harpoon (TM).

The code is a few years old now, and not maintained. Use at your peril :)
